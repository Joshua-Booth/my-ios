<!-- ## Focus

I have two active spaces on my phone to minimize hand movement. Everything is optimized for reachability and partly aesthetics. I use dark mode most always on iOS. On macOS I tend to vary between light and dark themes preferring light theme.

iPhone for me is a consumption and communication device primarily. Everything I can do on the phone, I can do faster and better on [mac](https://github.com/joshua-booth/my-mac-os). Thus I limit the kinds of activities I do on the phone and don't do things for long. Podcasts, chat, Twitter/IG, photography.. -->

## Applications

Here is a list of apps I use the most, sorted by category and their importance.

### Productivity

#### [TickTick](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ticktick-to-do-list-calendar/id626144601) - Task manager

- My task manager of choice. I use lists and tags to organize my tasks and work on tasks based on priority. Habits are awesome too. It's by far the best task manager I've found in terms of features and UI/UX design, and worth paying for premium.

#### [Google Calendar](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/fantastical-2-for-iphone/id718043190?mt=8) - Calendar

- Prefer it to stock calendar app due to it's cleaner design.

#### [LastPass](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lastpass-password-manager/id324613447) - Password manager

- Can't live without the app. It holds all my passwords and anything private so that I only need to remember one thing. My master password. It seamlessly integrates with the OS so I can autofill saved passwords in seconds.

#### [Drive](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-drive/id507874739?mt=8) - Additional Cloud Storage

- All my documents (files) are stored in iCloud. However Google Docs/Sheets are amazing tools for collaborating on documents.

#### [GitHub](https://github.com/mobile) - GitHub on the Go

- Use it respond or create issues on GitHub & keep up to date on activity of my watched repos.

<!-- #### [Bobby](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bobby-track-subscriptions/id1059152023?mt=8)

- Use the app to track my ongoing subscriptions. I review it at the end of every month and update my budget for the month accordingly. -->

<!-- #### [Safari](https://www.apple.com/nz/safari/) - Browser

- One of the best features of Safari is fast access to bookmarks on opening of new tabs. Here are my top bookmarked sites I use:

### Social

<!-- #### [Telegram](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/telegram-x/id898228810?mt=8) - Messenger

- My favorite messenger due its speed, its ability to sync with a native macOS client and the many free and awesome stickers you can use. I use Pocket to add links I want to check at some point in time. I also use Telegram Saved Messages and send messages to myself (links/quick-todos) that are of higher priority than Pocket. Adding quick todo to Telegram is much quicker than 2Do and it is assumed that the todo/note will be dealt with as soon as possible. I also use Saved Messages to share media between devices. -->

#### [Twitter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apollo-for-reddit/id979274575?mt=8) - Entertainment

- Use it to follow a few good accounts on tech and other random topics.

#### [Zoho Mail](https://www.zoho.com/mail/) - Mail client

- My favorite email client that I love due its UX as well as separation of emails based on their type (Inbox, newsletters). The UI of it could use some work, but the best and cheapest cross-platform mail app I've found so far.

#### [Slack](https://itunes.apple.com/app/slack-team-communication/id618783545) - Work communication

- Only keep essential teams I am signed up on there.

### Photos

#### [Photos](https://www.apple.com/nz/ios/photos/) - Photo library

- The place for all my personal photos/videos synced with iCloud. I love its Memories features.

<!-- #### [Darkroom](https://darkroom.co) - Photo & video editor

- Use it to quickly edit photographs I made as prefer its filters and editing options than other photo editors. -->

#### [Instagram](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt%3D8) - Photo sharing

- Use it as a way to [share my design portfolio](https://www.instagram.com/joshuabooth.nz/) outside of my [website](https://joshuabooth.nz/).

### Learn

#### [YouTube](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-watch-listen-stream/id544007664)

- Use it to watch videos with premium for no ads.

#### [Books](https://www.apple.com/ibooks/)

- Use it to read books (PDF & EPUB).

#### [Spotify](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spotify-new-music-and-podcasts/id324684580) - Podcasts

- Lets me listen to the most of the podcasts I enjoy.

<!-- ### Write

#### [Ulysses](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?mt=8) - Writing

- I use the app to make edits to my wiki. Since the wiki is a bunch of markdown files in a folder that I keep on Dropbox, I can add that folder to Ulysses as external folder and make edits to it. -->

### Music

#### [Spotify](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music/id324684580?mt=8) - Music streaming

- Love using it due to superior music recommendation, podcasts, UI/UX and social features like playlist sharing.

### Travel

#### [Google Maps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps-transit-food/id585027354?mt=8) - GPS, City Navigation & Traffic

- Use it as my main navigation app.
